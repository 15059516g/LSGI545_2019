# Introduction to ArcGIS Pro

We will primarily be using ArcGIS Pro in LSGI 545, although we will also make use of ArcGIS 10.6. For those that need an introduction to ArcGIS Pro, please refer to this [Quickstart Tutorial](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/pro-quickstart-tutorials.htm) from ESRI.
